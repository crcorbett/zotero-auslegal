# Zotero - auslegal

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use, open-source tool aimed at helping you collect, organize, cite, and share your research sources. 
This repository is a collection of Javascript web translators written for the open-source referencing program Zotero, covering a range of databases typically used in legal research. 

Due to issues with how Safari deals with authentication cookies and limitations within Zotero, the translators work best within Google Chrome. 

For more information on how to use this source code, see the [Zotero wiki](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/source_code).
