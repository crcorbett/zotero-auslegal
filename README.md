# Zotero - auslegal

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use, open-source tool aimed at helping you collect, organize, cite, and share your research sources. 
This repository is a collection of Javascript web translators written for the open-source reference management program Zotero, covering a range of databases typically used in legal research. 

Due to issues with how Safari deals with authentication cookies and limitations within Zotero, attachment downloads may fail within Safari and it is therefore advised that Chrome be used. 

For more information on how to use this source code, see the [Zotero wiki](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/source_code).
